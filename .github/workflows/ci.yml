# GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow
# 
# This workflow runs on every push and pull request to the main branch.
# - For all events: Runs tests and builds the project
# - For pushes to main: Also deploys to Netlify
#
# Required GitHub Secrets:
# - NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: Your Netlify personal access token
#   (Get it from: https://app.netlify.com/user/applications#personal-access-tokens)
# - NETLIFY_SITE_ID: Your Netlify site ID
#   (Find it in your Netlify site settings under Site details)
#
# To modify:
# - Node version: Update the 'node-version' in the setup-node step
# - Test script: Update the 'npm test' command if your test script changes
# - Build script: Update the 'npm run build' command if your build script changes
# - Build directory: Update 'publish-dir' in the deploy step if your build output changes
